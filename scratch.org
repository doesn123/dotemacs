- energy 137 per month. fixed contract, must let them know a month before we cancel when we have to leave. roughly 50eu cancellation fee
- therefore internet + energy is 41,50 pp
- rent is 1372,80: 343 for G and A and 358 for O and 328 for C
- A owes me 384,5. C owes me 369.50 and O owes me 399.5

Be sure your PC/Laptop Have a Bluetooth Support.
    Install “bluez” package^
    Install “bluez-utils” package^
    Create the file in systemd directory, in this exact location: ~/.config/systemd/user/mpris-proxy.service. The file should contain these lines:

[Unit]
Description=Forward bluetooth media controls to MPRIS

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpris-proxy

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Start service with user flag (“–user”)

systemctl --user start mpris-proxy.service

then check it, its running? MPRIS Command and test it on your bluetooth device.

If you want to start automaticly you can

systemctl --user enable mpris-proxy.service

^(maybe different depending on your distro)
